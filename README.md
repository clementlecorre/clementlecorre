### Hi there 👋👋


I’m DevOps Engineer from France 🇫🇷🥖! 

I mostly like to work Kubernetes and container technology stacks 🐳 or cloud platforms like AWS ☁️ (certified Cloud Architect) where I automate deployments with Cloud formation or Terraform. 

I spend my time working on different projects like [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io) or [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io) or create DevOps apps in Golang.

* [Scheduled & distributed Cypress tests for multiple environments & clients with Argo](http://❤️☁️.ws)
